Write a program that repeatedly asks the user for a scale F or a C (for "Fahrenheit" or "Celsius") on one line followed by an integer temperature on the next line. It then converts the given temperature to the other scale. Use the formulas:
F = (9/5)C + 32

C = (5/9)(F - 32)
Exit the loop when the user types "Q". Assume that all input is correct. For example:
Enter Scale      : F
Enter Temperature: 32
Celsius Temperature: 0C

Enter Scale      : C
Enter Temperature: 100
Fahrenheit Temperature: 212F

Enter Scale      : Q
done
